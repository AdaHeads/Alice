A few things to remember when creating a new test:

* "with shared.gpr" in the test project file.
* Use Ada.Command_Line to set the exit status of the test.
* Remember that all executable files in the test directory _will_ be executed.
* Use the "test_name.argument" file to add commandline parameters to the test.
* Take a look at the "common" test. This is very simple and can be used as a
  foundation for new tests.
