--------------------
--  Introduction  --
--------------------

Alice provides the glue between a PBX such as FreeSWITCH/Asterisk, a PostgreSQL
RDBM's and a client. She works by accepting plain HTTP commands in the shape of
GET/POST and returning JSON objects to the client.

Alice is GPLv3, see COPYING3 and COPYING.RUNTIME.

--------------------
--  Dependencies  --
--------------------

Alice depends on Yolk, AWS and GNATColl being compiled with PostgreSQL support.

--------------------------
--  The Alice Protocol  --
--------------------------

Talking to Alice is done through a very simple HTTP protocol. Getting data is
done via plain GET parameters, and the data returned is always JSON. Setting
data is done via POST parameters, and returned data is JSON.
