--------------------
--  Introduction  --
--------------------

Alice converts LDAP queries to JSON, and JSON to LDAP queries, depending on
whether a client is reading from or writing to the LDAP server.

Alice is GPLv3, see COPYING3 and COPYING.RUNTIME.

--------------------
--  Dependencies  --
--------------------

Alice depends on Yolk and on AWS being compiled with LDAP support.

--------------------------
--  The Alice Protocol  --
--------------------------

Talking to Alice is done through a very simple HTTP protocol. Getting data is
done via plain GET parameters, and the data returned is always JSON. Setting
data is done via POST parameters, and returned data is JSON.
