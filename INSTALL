Building Alice simply requires that you have Yolk installed on your system and
that GNATCOLL has been compiled with PostgreSQL support. If those two dependencies
are met, then all you have to do is:

    $ make

You now have a fully functioning Alice server in the exe/ directory. Remember that
Alice needs a Yolk config.ini file in the configuration/ directory. You can use the
base config.ini.dist file that comes with Yolk as a base for this.

You can build a debug version of Alice with:

    $ make debug

If you have valgrind available on your system, you can try running this version
with:

    $ valgrind -v --leak-check=full \
                  --show-possibly-lost=no \
                  --track-origins=yes alice
