To build Alice all you have to do is:

    $ cd Alice/
    $ make

Set the DATABASE=PostgreSQL environment variable if you want to use that
instead of the default SQLite database.

If you have a multicore system you can set the PROCESSORS=n environment
variable to speed things up.

You now have a fully functioning Alice server in the Alice/exe/ directory. You
can use one of the controller scripts found in tools/ to start/stop Alice.

You can build a debug version of Alice with:

    $ make debug

If you have valgrind available on your system, you can try running this version
with:

    $ valgrind -v --leak-check=full \
                  --show-possibly-lost=no \
                  --track-origins=yes alice
