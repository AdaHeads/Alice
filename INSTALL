Building Alice simply requires that you have Yolk installed on your system and
that AWS has been compiled with LDAP support. If those two dependencies are met,
then all you have to do is:

    $ make

You now have a fully functioning Alice server in the exe/ directory.

You can build a debug version of Alice with:

    $ make debug

If you have valgrind available on your system, you can try running this version
with:

    $ valgrind -v --leak-check=full \
                  --show-possibly-lost=no \
                  --track-origins=yes alice
