Alice Protocol




Table of Contents






1 Introduction

Alice acts as the connector between one or more NAME_OF_PRODUCT 
clients, a PostgreSQL data store and one ore more PBX'es. Her 
main task is to get and set data via a HTTP/JSON based protocol. 
This document is the final authority on the Alice protocol.

2 The Protocol

When data is requested (get) the search parameters are always 
given as a HTTP GET query string and the result is always 
returned as a JSON document. When data is 
inserted/updated/deleted (set) the parameters are always given as 
a HTTP POST request and the confirmation returned from Alice will 
always be a JSON document.

In order to access any of the interfaces, a client must first 
authenticate itself. This is done using OpenID. The login 
interface is the only interface that can be accessed without 
prior login.

All data handled by the protocol is expected to be UTF-8 encoded. 
Alice does not check whether this is in fact the case, so when 
implementing clients, be sure to verify that all data sent to 
Alice are UTF-8 encoded.

Application level errors and exceptions are returned as JSON 
documents. How these are handled is entirely up to the client. 
HTTP level errors are returned as normal for HTTP servers.

3 The Data Model

Instead of using only a relational or document based model, we've 
opted for a mixture. Data that is relational in nature is stored 
in columns in a relational database, whereas everything else is 
stored in a JSON document. When a client requests a specific type 
of data Alice combines these two storage models into a final JSON 
document.

A benefit of this is that the client software easily can add new 
fields, simply by expanding on the JSON document. If we take the 
/get/contact interface as an example, it might return a JSON 
looking like this:

{

  "name":"Arthur Dent",

  “items”:[”towel”,”heart of gold”,”dressing gown”],

  “emailaddress”:”arthurdent42@somewhere.unknown.org”,

  “cellphone”:”555-777-888-999”,

  “dislikes”:”Vogons”,

  “db_columns”:

    {

      "ce_id":1,

      "ce_name":"Arthur Dent",

      “sip_uri”:”sip://arthurdent.somewhere”

    }

}

The db_columns JSON node is build from the actual columns 
available in the relational database, in this case ce_id, ce_name 
and sip_uri. The data found in these columns can be queried, 
sorted, grouped and/or joined by Alice. She is, so to speak, 
aware of them. 

The other JSON nodes (name, items, emailaddress, cellphone, 
dislikes) comes from the JSON document associated with a contact 
entity. This is controlled 100% by the client software. Alice is 
completely oblivious as to what this document contains and why. 
Things put here are only searchable by the client.

The strength of this model is that new fields can be added to a 
contact entity on the fly, without needing any changes to Alice 
or the database. Changes to Alice and/or the database itself is 
only necessary if the new field must be searchable by Alice.

The weakness of this model is of course that a poorly 
designed/build client can end up with some very bad JSON. We 
believe the strength outweighs the weakness.

4 Exceptions

When bad things happen an exception is raised and an error JSON 
document returned. These have the following format:

{

  "exception_message":"foo", 

  "exception":"SOME.EXCEPTION", 

  "message":"bar"

}

All exceptions have this format. It is entirely up to the client 
to decide what to do with an exception.

5 Getting Data

5.1 /get/contact?ce_id=[natural integer]

This interface returns the JSON document associated with the 
contact entity identified by ce_id. Example JSON document:

{

  "name":"Arthur Dent",

  “db_columns”:

    {

      "ce_id":1,

      "ce_name":"Arthur Dent",

      “sip_uri”:”sip://arthurdent.somewhere”

    }

}

An empty JSON document is returned if ce_id doesn't exist in the 
database:

{}

5.2 /get/contact_attributes?ce_id=[natural integer]

This interface returns the attributes associated with the ce_id 
contact entity. Example JSON document:

{

  "attributes":

  [

    {

      "phone":"555-777-888", 

      "db_columns":

        {

          "ce_id":1, 

          "org_id":1

        }, 

      "email":"some@email.address"

    },

    {

      "phone":"999-000-111", 

      "db_columns":

        {

          "ce_id":1, 

          "org_id":2

        }, 

      "email":"some.other@email.address"

    }

  ]

}



Note that attributes contains an array, meaning that one contact 
entity can be associated with several attribute sets. This means 
that the attributes of a contact entity can change depending on 
the context in which it is seen.

If there are no attributes associated with a contact entity, the 
following JSON document is returned:

{

  "attributes":[]

}



5.3 /get/contact_tags?ce_id=[natural integer]

This interface returns the tags associated with the ce_id contact 
entity. Example JSON document:

{

  "tags":

  [

    {

      "db_columns":

      {

        "ce_id":1, 

        "org_id":2

      }, 

      "tags":

      [

        "Ada", 

        "Slackware", 

        "Linux"

      ]

    }

  ]

}

As with the attributes interface the tags node contains an array 
so several tag sets can be associated with a contact entity.

If there are no tags associated with a contact entity, the 
following JSON document is returned:

{

  "tags":[]

}



5.4 /get/organization?org_id=[natural_integer]

This interface returns the data associated with the org_id 
organization. Example JSON:

{

  "name":"AdaHeads K/S", 

  "db_columns":

  {

    "org_name":"AdaHeads K/S", 

    "identifier":"sip://adaheads", 

    "org_id":1

  }

}

An empty JSON document is returned if no org_id organization is 
found in the database:

{}

5.5 /get/org_contacts?org_id=[natural integer]

This interface returns all the contact entities associated with 
org_id. Example JSON:

{

  "contacts":

  [

    {

      "name":"Zaphod B.", 

      "db_columns":

      {

        "ce_id":4, 

        "org_id":2, 

        "ce_name":"Zaphod B."

      }

    }, 

    {

      "name":"Tricia Takanawa", 

      "db_columns":

      {

        "ce_id":1, 

        "org_id":2, 

        "ce_name":"Tricia Takanawa"

      }

    }

  ]

}

The contacts node contains an array, so it can hold multiple 
contact entities. If no contact entities are associated with the 
given org_id the following JSON document is returned:

{

  "contacts":[]

}

5.6 /get/org_contacts_attributes?org_id=[natural integer]

This interface returns all the contact entity attribute sets 
associated with org_id. Example JSON document:

{

  "attributes":

  [

    {

      "phone":"555-777-888", 

      "db_columns":

        {

          "ce_id":1, 

          "org_id":1

        }, 

      "email":"some@email.address"

    }, 

    {

      "phone":"444-555-777", 

      "db_columns":

        {

          "ce_id":7, 

          "org_id":1

        }, 

      "email":"contact@me.here"

    }

  ]

}

Because there can be several contact entity attribute sets 
associated an org_id the attributes JSON node contains an array. 
If there are no attribute sets, the following JSON document is 
returned:

{

  "attributes":[]

}

5.7 /get/org_contacts_tags?org_id=[natural integer]

This interface returns all the contact entity tag sets associated 
with org_id. Example JSON document:

{

  "tags":

  [

    {

      "tags":

      [

        "Ada", 

        "Slackware", 

        "Linux"

      ],

      "db_columns":

        {

          "ce_id":1, 

          "org_id":1

        }

    }, 

    {

      "tags":

      [

        "Support", 

        "Accounting", 

        "Sales"

      ],

      "db_columns":

        {

          "ce_id":7, 

          "org_id":1

        }

    }

  ]

}

The tags JSON node contains an array because there can be several 
contact entity tag sets associated with an org_id. If there are 
no tag sets, the following JSON document is returned:

{

  "tags":[]

}

5.8 /get/queue

This interface returns the current call queue. This is updated 
once each second, so polling the /get/queue interface more often 
than once each second is both wasteful and pointless. Calling for 
example:

/get/queue

will return a JSON string like this:

{     

  "normal": 

    [         

      {             

        "UTC_start_date":"2012-02-22 14:23:30",

        "id":"GDhcf2VBww",               

        "unix_timestamp":"1329920610",             

        "callee":5,             

        "caller":"d7sIp1kR"         

      }

    ],

  "high": 

    [         

      {              

        "UTC_start_date":"2012-02-22 14:23:11",

        "id":"bRbYsMUVqx",             

        "unix_timestamp":"1329920591",                 

        "callee":3,             

        "caller":"oCgDF7ua"         

      }

    ],

  "low": 

    [         

      {             

        "UTC_start_date":"2012-02-22 14:23:17",            

       "id":"VV8BFqGpqG",             

        "unix_timestamp":"1329920597",              

        "callee":9,             

       "caller":"ZQsRogwB"         

      }

    ],

  “length”:3

}

The normal, low and high nodes represent priority in the queue. 
All these naturally contains arrays of calls. The length node 
contains the totalt length of the queue. The callee node maps to 
an org_id. An empty queue returns the following JSON document:

{

  "normal":[], 

  "length":0, 

  "high":[], 

  "low":[]

}

5.9 /get/queue_length

This interface returns the length of the current call queue. 
Example JSON document:

{

  "length":7

}
